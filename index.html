                <p>
                    Kanji Sensei is a smartphone app that helps you learn kanji and vocabulary easily. No need to
                    search and download decks online.
                    Kanji sensei offers kanji writing practice with stroke recognition, kanji reading in context (within
                    words), meaning, and kanji extended info out of the box.

                <h2>KAI Language School</h2>
                <p>
                    Kanji Sensei started as a small, side project to help me study for Japan's KAI Language School kanji
                    tests during levels 4 and 5. If you're a KAI student like me, you'll find the app specially useful
                    in a few ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The kanji deck that comes with the app follows the content of
                            <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E5%A2%97%E8%A3%9C%E6%94%B9%E8%A8%82%E7%89%88-%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E7%B7%8F%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A8%E3%82%81-N2%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97-%E4%BD%90%E3%80%85%E6%9C%A8%E4%BB%81%E5%AD%90/dp/4866394943">日本語総まとめN2</a>,
                            the book used in KAI to study kanji (at the time of this writing) during levels 4 and 5
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The deck is configured so that certain kanjis will suggest you practice their writing. This
                            is based on KAI's kanji materials around which kanjis' writing to learn for the exams,
                            making it a great tool to study
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Likewise, at the end of every deck, Kanji Sensei offers a little kanji meaning quizz
                            following once again KAI's kanji tests material
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You have the chance to suggest improvements based on your experience at KAI should you think of
                        anything useful to add to the app during your tenure. To do so, please check the
                        <a href="#faq-how-contribute">How can I contribute to Kanji Sensei?</a> FAQ section.

                <p>
                    I hope this app helps you with your kanji studying as much as it's helped me, and that, together,
                    we can make it improve little by little. To do so, you can <a href="#download">start testing</a>

                        ℹ️ As this is a pre-beta version of the app, there could be some inaccuracies or straight out
                        wrong information. Much of it comes from open sourced datasets, and I'll keep striving to
                        gather together the best I can find. If you catch any of that or, otherwise, you come up with
                        ideas to improve the app, please <a href="#contact">drop me a line</a>.

                <p>
                    If you're anything like me, you want your kanji studied anywhere (train commute anyone?),
                    with the ability to not only practice reading but also writing, while learning not only the shape of
                    the kanji but also the right stroke order. All of that out of the box, without having to find,
                    download, and configure your decks. Moreover, the decks already come with their English translation,
                    so that they're ready for you to start studying right away.

                <p>
                    As of this writing, I've been both developing <strong>and</strong> using Kanji Sensei for and with
                    the content studied at KAI. You'll find decks developed to suit KAI's studying materials and exams.
                    If you're a KAI student, the app in its current form is specifically well suited for you. You can
                    check the details <a href="#kai">in this section</a>.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    No, Kanji Sensei is an independent app developed during my tenure at KAI, but there's no other
                    relationship between the app and the school. The app doesn't collect or share any information with
                    the school, and it doesn't represent KAI in any way.
